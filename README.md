# MicroApp

Hackathon template to create a microapp

# Development

## Single Page Application (SPA)
A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts 
with the web browser by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data
from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire
new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a
native app.

Ayoba Microapps are based on this concept and helps to external developers to
increase the functionalities of Ayoba.

## Extra info
